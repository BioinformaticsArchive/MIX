GAGE Dataset 
=============

* Downloaded from the [GAGE website](http://gage.cbcb.umd.edu/) on May 14th 2013. 
* Only assemblies for [R.sphaeroides](http://gage.cbcb.umd.edu/data/Rhodobacter_sphaeroides/) and [S.aureus](http://gage.cbcb.umd.edu/data/Staphylococcus_aureus/) were downloaded, and scaffold assemblies were removed.
* Each assembly was renamed from "genome.ctg.fasta" by prepending name of assembler (e.g. abyss.ctg.fasta for the ABySS assemblies )
