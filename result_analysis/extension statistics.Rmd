```{r}
library(data.table)
setwd("~/temp/MIX/result_assemblies/")
m_abs_AB_SP_al <- fread("M_abscessus_AB_MS_mix/Mix_results_A500_C0/all_alignments.csv")
m_abs_AB_SP_ctg <- fread("M_abscessus_AB_MS_mix/Mix_results_A500_C0/all_contigs.csv")
```

AB largest contig is not included in the solution
```{r}
m_abs_AB_SP_ctg[order(length)]
```
Seems like it's not selected at all
